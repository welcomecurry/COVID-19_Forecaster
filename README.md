# COVID-19 Forecaster
Take in number of confirmed cases from csv, manipulate data into a DataFrame then plot data. This script can plot four different graphs: Plot data, plot trend, plot seasonality and finally a prediction model which takes in previous data and predicts the number of confirmed cases per day via ExponentialSmoothing. All graphs can be seen in files. Graphs are using data from 04/03/2020 for reference.
